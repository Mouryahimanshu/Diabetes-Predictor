# Diabetes Predictor

This repository contains a web-based application for predicting diabetes using machine learning. The application is built using Python, `scikit-learn` for machine learning, and `Gradio` for the user interface. This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful tool for predicting diabetes based on user inputs of various health parameters.

## Features

- **Interactive Web Interface:** Users can input health parameters to predict the likelihood of diabetes.
- **Machine Learning Model:** The application uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on the diabetes dataset.
- **User-Friendly:** The interface is built with Gradio, making it accessible and easy to use.
- **Lightweight:** Requires minimal dependencies and runs in any environment that supports Python.
